# Caddy with Layer4

This directory contains Docker build script for Caddy with layer4 support.

LiveKit can utilize Caddy's automatic certificate management when deployed.

You are welcome to use your own Caddy build or customize this one.
We require Caddy to be compiled with [Layer4](https://github.com/mholt/caddy-l4) and [YAML](https://github.com/abiosoft/caddy-yaml) modules.
